## Project:
This is a remake of the famous mobile game Flappy Bird, originally release in 2013 to iOS and later to Android.

### How to play:
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player presses ArrowUp on the keyboard. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.

## Next steps:
> I'm going to implement improvements to make the game adapt its size responsively to different screens and devices.<br><br>
> I have planned to implement in this application improvements related to accessibility, as it is very important that it can be played properly by everyone!
